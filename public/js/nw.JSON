Will this mean we will be seeing more things related to Roman and Viking culture soon? When will we see bits of Egypt?\n\nLooking forward to seeing what will be added. New weapons, armor skin and maybe type (banded and padded?), furnishings (I hope I can create a stone Kirin statue), mobs (Orgres, goblins, and kappas oh my!) and possibly much more!",

      "content": "In July we ended our Alpha Test for New World. We had enough feedback to understand we needed more time to develop the mid and end game. But before we went dark for an extended delay we wanted to share our progress so far with everyone who had supported New World up to that point. We organized a Density Test to make sure we could handle hundreds of thousands of players then ran a 10 day Preview event in late August. It was a chance to share the state of the game with the broadest audience yet, let people share their experiences and draw their own opinions, and provide us a ton of feedback and data. \n\nNow we are back in development and Alpha Testing will resume soon. We are working on new features and content to address the feedback we received and we'll share more about that as soon as we can.\n\nHope this clears things up.",

      "parent_content": "I was super excited for a modern MMO that had action combat as well as crafting/gathering etc so I bought the game with some friends before looking at too much of the media around it. We played the game together through the beta and had many of the same issues as the community with the lack of content and abysmal questing.\n\nBut we sort of explained it away with the fact that it was an open beta and the game had already decided it would be delayed for a year. We figured they had intentionally removed content they didn't want to spoil for the users in terms of quest stories and possibly unique/rarer items or recipes. I don't know, for whatever \\*oomph\\* was missing from the game, it seemed possible that the deeper content was simply still in the works and the devs underestimated how much the content would be scrutinized - or something.\n\nSo my question is, was that the entirety of the game content we were supposed to expect at their launch (had they not got feedback) or could they have intentionally showed us only a taster since it was open beta?\n\nEDIT: It was all explained away because, largely, we all really really liked the game. It felt like an incredibly well built foundation but with absolutely nothing on top.",
